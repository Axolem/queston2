                        Good Evening Fellow South African.
                        During lockdown level 4 you will be able to smoke
                        cigarettes. COGTA minister will provide the details on
                        this matter.

                        No! Lockdown level 4 you will not be
                        allowed to smoke. Because when people Zol they put
                        saliva on the Zol and they share that Zol. So It’s risky
                        during Covid-19 pandemic.

                        When the initial decision was taken, we obviously had also gleaned
                        on the advice that was there from the medical field.

                            <p> The change came about because of a flurry of concerns and objections

                    The overarching rationale for the decision to temporarily ban the
                    sale of tobacco products during Level 4 of the lockdown was to protect human life
                    and health, and to reduce the potential strain on the healthcare system

                        We are going to migrate to another level. Those who are hankering
                        for tobacco must know that it is only a matter of time before their hankering is
                        assuaged or addressed

                            This duty is particularly acute in the pandemic situation in which
